## v2024.4.1

The April 2024 release brings a improvements and bug fixes to both the iOS and mac apps.

If you feel generous and have a couple of minutes, please leave a [review on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1433266971?action=write-review). It makes a huge difference for me. Thank you in advance.

- Fixed bug where local feed preferences were sometimes overwritten during sync.

- Fixed a bug where the app would sometimes crash when syncing the background. 

- Fixed show article covers from enclosures, matches iOS/iPadOS app now
