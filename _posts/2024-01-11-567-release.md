- Local notifications are now delivered more reliably.
- Moving feeds across folders or out of folders no longer crashes the app.
- Folder counts are now updated more reliably, using fewer resources.
- Implements importing/exporting feed settings under the “File” menu.
- Fixed subscribing and unsubscribing to push notifications on a feed.
