### 2024.4.0

- Fixed syncing of feed updates and changes across devices.

- Improved sync: changes to feeds and folders are now picked up before syncing articles begins. 

- Fixed a bug where article enclosures would not get saved properly to disk. 

- Fixed a bug where articles with no explict cover image assigned, would show no cover image, if it had an image enclosure. 

- Fixed a bug where article enclosures without any articles would linger around consuming disk space. These are now cleaned up when the app starts.

- Build using Xcode 15.3

### 2024.2.2

### 2024.2.1
