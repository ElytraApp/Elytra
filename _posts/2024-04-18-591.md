### 2024.4.1

- Fixed bug where local feed preferences were sometimes overwritten during sync.

- Fixed a bug where the sync progress bar would immediately dismiss after sync completed. It now shows the completed state for a second before resetting its state. 

- Fixed show article covers from enclosures, matches iOS/iPadOS app now.
